# ReadMe Generator
This is a ReadMe generator, a user can type in ‘node index.js’ to retrieve the file. In the console (terminal) the user will be prompted for their GitHub username, followed by a series of prompts about their project.

### BUILT WITH
Software used to create this generator include: Javascript, Nodejs, NPM Inquirer, and NPM Axios.

### NOTES ABOUT THE PROCESS
- In Develop>testFiles, there are several different .js files with the name of test/ index or Api with a number assigned. After working on these files; pieces from all 4 documents were moved to the "master" files: index.js, apis.js, generateMarkdown.js
- I was unable to have the WriteFile function generate a README.md.
