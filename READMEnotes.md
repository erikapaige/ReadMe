# ReadMe Generator
This is a ReadMe generator, a user can type in ‘node index.js’ to retrieve the file. In the console (terminal) the user will be prompted for their GitHub username, followed by a series of prompts about their project.

### BUILT WITH
Software used to create this generator include: Javascript, Nodejs, NPM Inquirer, and NPM Axios.

### NOTES ABOUT THE PROCESS
- In Develop>testFiles, there are 4 different .js files. 'testApi.js' and 'testIndex.js' were the first files I wrote. As the code evolved I created 'testApi2.js' and 'testIndex2.js'. After working on these files; pieces from all 4 documents were moved to the "master" file, index.js
